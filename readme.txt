Post on your social media platforms straight from your product detail and see the real impact your social media activity has on engagement and sales.

== Description ==
Ever thought of an easier way to create engaging posts on social media that will help you sell more? Well, you know what they say….where there’s a will, there’s a way, and we’ve got a way...

Social media posting is as smooth as butter with this plugin. You can easily:
* create a social media post from your product detail
* enrich the post with information related to your product including price, description and pictures
* get feedback on which posts bring you the best results – social media engagement and, most importantly, orders

Thanks to the integration with your WooCommerce account, social media posting is not only easy, but also organised. All the content you use to publish posts on social media sits right in your WooCommerce account. You just need to use it the right way.

Download the free version of Social Media Posting by groost to save time and use the right incentives in order to sell more products.

Note: Currently, we support Facebook and are developing other social media networks that will be launched soon.

== Installation ==

1.	Is the plugin free?
Yes, it is!

2.	How do I enrich the post with related information?
Thanks to the integration with WooCommerce, you can use any product-related information like name, price, description and paste it as a variable to the post’s main text. In other words, you don't have to copy & paste the information, it just appears in the post by clicking a single button.

3.	What results can I see in the post reporting?
We help you evaluate your social media activity by showing you the engagement of your posts, such as comments, likes and shares.  We can also show you orders that a particular post brought.
